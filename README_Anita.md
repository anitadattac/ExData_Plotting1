## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following describes the process of creating the plots

* Step 1: Create the subset of data by executing plot_dataset_create.R. This file creates the dataset for plots which has data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02
* Step 2: Execute plot1.R to create plot1.png file
* Step 3: Execute plot2.R to create plot2.png file
* Step 4: Execute plot3.R to create plot3.png file
* Step 5: Execute plot4.R to create plot4.png file
